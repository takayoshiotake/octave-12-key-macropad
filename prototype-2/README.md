## CircuitPython

Software for the Octave (prototype-2) runs on CircuitPython.
You can fetch the CircuitPython source code for the Octave from the following GitHub repo.

**Stable:**

- üîó [takayoshiotake/circuitpython:7.3.x-board-octave-rp2040](https://github.com/takayoshiotake/circuitpython/tree/7.3.x-board-octave-rp2040)

## Software

## Issues

- [x] Fatal: SW21 and SW22 do not work.
  ‚Ü™Ô∏é BOOT, RESET works when manually shorted to GND by wire.
  ‚Ü™Ô∏é Fixed schematics and PCB in rev.5.0.3
- [x] Fatal: Rotation cannot be detected because SingalA and SignalB do not go to Low level due to the value of R11, R13 in the schematic rev.5.0.2.
  ‚Ü™Ô∏é It can be solved by removing R1 and R3 and using pull-up of RP2040 instead, or use a **small** value such as 1K for R11 and R13.
  ‚Ü™Ô∏é Fixed schematics and PCB in rev.5.0.4
- [x] The incremental encoder and stick controller are difficult to operate with this placement on the PCB.
  ‚Ü™Ô∏é These input devices are not considered important and will be removed in the next version. It should be simple.
- [x] Custom MCU boards are expensive to manufacture and require a lot of work, including the need for USB VID/PID. Also, the board is larger due to the USB-C connector.
  ‚Ü™Ô∏é It seems that it would be better to separate the IO board from the MCU board. However, if they are connected with pin headers, it will be difficult to design a housing as in Prototype 1, so I think it is better to connect them with cables.
  ‚Ü™Ô∏é Considered in next prototype.

## Results

Remove the incremental encoders and stick controller.
And for the next prototype, I will consider whether to divide the PCB into an MCU board and an IO board, and whether to adopt a custom MCU board.
